//Alex and Sam are good friends. Alex is doing a lot of programming these days. 
//He has set a target score of A for himself.
//Initially, Alex's score was zero. Alex can double his score by doing a question, 
//or Alex can seek help from Sam for doing questions that will contribute 1 to Alex's 
//score. Alex wants his score to be precisely A. Also, he does not want to take much help from Sam.
//Find and return the minimum number of times Alex needs to take help from Sam to achieve a score of A.

	 * solves a question, score : 2 Alex solves a question, score : 4 Takes help

	 * Takes help from Sam, score : 1
	 * double==2

	 * agar 2*2=4 s dkhoge to ans 4 aayega
	 * sam ki help =1
	 * double=2 then double 4
	 * ab 3 baar or sam ki help leni pdegi 7 k liye to total 4 ho jata pr apn ko
