//Given an array A of length N where all the elements are distinct and are in the range [1, N+2].
//Two numbers from the range [1, N+2] are missing from the array A. Find the two missing numbers.

//Hint:-
//How about taking xor of all numbers present in array as well as all numbers from 1 to N+2?
//This will give you a resultant number which is equal to XOR of two missing numbers. 
//Now, think on how to extract those two missing numbers from this resultant number.
