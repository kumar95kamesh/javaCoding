/**
 * You have the following constraints:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
You have to find the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.
You have to return a 2D array of dimensions M x 3, where M is the minimum number of moves needed to solve the problem.
In each row, there should be 3 integers (disk, start, end), where:

disk - number of the disk being moved
start - number of the tower from which the disk is being moved
end - number of the tower to which the disk is being moved
